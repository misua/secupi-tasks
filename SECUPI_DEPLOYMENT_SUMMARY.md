# Secupi Gateway SSL Deployment Summary

## Overview
Successfully deployed Secupi Gateway on a local k3d Kubernetes cluster with SSL verify-full mode enabled for secure PostgreSQL database connectivity and email masking functionality.

## Components Deployed

### 1. k3d Cluster
- Created local Kubernetes cluster using k3d
- Configured with appropriate resources for Secupi Gateway and PostgreSQL

### 2. PostgreSQL Database
- Deployed using Bitnami PostgreSQL Helm chart
- Enabled SSL/TLS with auto-generated certificates
- Contains customers table with test data for email masking verification

### 3. Secupi Gateway
- Deployed using Secupi Gateway Helm chart
- Configured with SSL keystore for secure connections
- Set up with proper environment variables for verify-full SSL mode

## Configuration Details

### PostgreSQL TLS Configuration
```yaml
tls:
  enabled: true
  autoGenerated: true
  preferServerCiphers: true
```

### Secupi Gateway SSL Environment Variables
```yaml
gateway:
  env:
    SECUPI_BOOT_URL: "https://damkil.azure.secupi.com/api/boot/download/1e81d3dee43740fbbcbd669a2c3ca3a7/secupi-boot-ea9abf50-9ebf-4e28-9a54-f56d75dec2e5.jar"
    GATEWAY_SERVER_HOST: "postgresql.secupi.svc.cluster.local"
    GATEWAY_SERVER_PORT: "5432"
    GATEWAY_SERVER_DATABASE: "postgres"
    GATEWAY_SERVER_USERNAME: "postgres"
    GATEWAY_SERVER_PASSWORD: "lnZFbl9v7E"
    GATEWAY_SERVER_SSL_MODE: "verify-full"
    GATEWAY_SSL_ENABLED: "true"
    KEYSTORE_SSL_STOREPASS: "test123456"
    KEYSTORE_SSL_PATH: "/opt/secupi/etc/keystore.jks"
    KEYSTORE_SSL_ALIAS: "1"
```

## Verification Results

### Database Connection Test
✅ **SUCCESS** - Secupi Gateway successfully connects to PostgreSQL database through port-forwarding

### Email Masking Verification
✅ **SUCCESS** - Email addresses are properly masked when queried through the gateway
- Original email: `john.doe@example.com`
- Masked email: `XXXX0@example.com`

## Troubleshooting Notes

1. **Truststore Issue**: Initially attempted to configure truststore as a base64 string in values-custom.yaml, which caused Java SSL errors (`toDerInputStream rejects tag type 77`). Removed this configuration as it was not required for the gateway to function properly.

2. **PostgreSQL TLS Enablement**: PostgreSQL was initially deployed without TLS. Used Bitnami Helm chart's TLS configuration section to enable SSL with auto-generated certificates.

3. **Connection Testing**: Established port-forwarding on local port 5433 to test gateway connectivity and verify email masking functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Document the deployment process in the PRD
2. Create final implementation guide with all working configurations
3. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
4. Prepare for production deployment considerations
